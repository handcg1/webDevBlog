       <p>
        This week I decided to implement a feature that allows you to roll a dice. If you are creating any sort of internet game with a dice component this would be really helpful. I followed a tutorial from GreeksforGreeks which can be found <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/building-a-dice-game-using-javascript/" target="_blank">here</a>. I only implemented the dice rolling component from this tutorial as that was all I was trying to learn how to implement. Some major takeaways I had are the setTimeout method and Math.random() in Javascript. 
       </p>

       <p> The javascript used to create the dice roll is below. </p>

       <pre> function rollTheDice() { 
        setTimeout(function () { 
            var randomNumber1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1; 
            var randomNumber2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1; 
    
            document.querySelector(".img1").setAttribute("src", 
                "dice" + randomNumber1 + ".png"); 
    
            document.querySelector(".img2").setAttribute("src", 
                "dice" + randomNumber2 + ".png"); 
    
        }, 1000); 
    } 
    </pre>

    <p> 
        This javascript is invoked by using the onClick attribute on the ‘roll the dice’ button. I had never used the setTimeout method before so I looked it up and found a really helpful article which can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp" target="_blank">here</a>. I learned that setTimeout calls a function or evaluates an expression after the specific time given in milliseconds. For the dice roll, the setTimeout calls a function that randomly sets an image of the dice face. The setTimeout allows you to simulate the action of actually rolling the dice. This method could be used for a lot of different purposes and it is good to know that javascript has such a method. 
    </p>

    <p> The Math.random() function is also very useful. Most programming languages have a similar function. In javascript you can used Math.random() to return a value with a specific max and min by multiplying it by the max and then adding the min as done below in the dice example. </p>
    
    <pre> var randomNumber1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1; 
    </pre>

            <p> 
                This week I decided to look into image mapping. 
                Image mapping allows a user to click on different parts of an image to see more information or be redirected. 
                To learn about image mapping, I followed a tutorial from w3schools which can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp" target="_blank"> here</a>. 
                I found image mapping to be a fun way to interact with pictures beyond just looking at them. 
                I think this feature can be really useful in a lot of different ways. 
                For example, it could be used for a museum website where users can click on different parts of an image to get more information about the image or zoom in. 
                Image mapping could also be used for a website that sells clothes. Users could click on an article of clothing they liked and then be redirected to a page where they could purchase that piece of clothing. 
                In my implementation I have a picture of Isabell, the dog I am fostering. 
                You can click on her left ear, and nose to learn more about her. 
            </p>
   
        <map name="map">
            <area id="left-ear" shape="circle" coords="128,130,40" alt="Dog head"  onclick="show('ear')">
            <area id="nose" shape="square" coords="160,210,200,260" alt="Dog head"  onclick="show('nose')">
        </map>

        <p> Image mapping works by creating a base image and then linking it to the map by using the usemap attribute as seen below. </p>

        <pre> 
            &lt;img id="mapped" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50346331603_93ab984b1a_b.jpg" alt="German shepherd sittng on bed" usemap="#map">
        </pre>

        <p> The map is created by using the map tag with different areas inside of it as seen below. </p>

        <pre> 
            &lt;map name="map">
            &lt;area id="left-ear" shape="circle" coords="128,130,40" alt="Dog head"  onclick="show('ear')">
            &lt;/map>
        </pre>

        <p> These areas can have different shapes such as circle or square and the coords attribute will change based on the specific shape. 
            One difficulty I had with image mapping was that the base image could not be resized to fit the browser because then the image map would be off. 
            Another challenge I faced was that it was hard to figure out the coordinates to put the areas in the right positions. 
            I ended up having to do a lot of guessing and checking.
            Additionally, I also wish it was easier to create a hover effect on the areas so the user could tell where the area is and where they can click. 
            I looked into this issue and found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26634273/adding-hover-effects-for-links-in-image-map-area">stack overflow article</a> that said the html area element does not accept hovering. I tried to implement their solution which involved Jquery but I ran into trouble getting it to work.

          <script>
              function show(id) {
                  var element; 
                    element = document.getElementById(id);
                    element.style.display = "block"; 
                    document.getElementById('base-image').style.display = "none";
              }

              function back(id) {
                document.getElementById('base-image').style.display = "block";
                document.getElementById(id).style.display = "none";
              }
          </script>
    </main>

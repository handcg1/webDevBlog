            <div id="text"> 
            <p> 
                This week I created a scrolling animation based off a tutorial by Online Tutorial Youtube channel which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cWKesvhFlg" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                I think this animation could be a really cool way to display a title of a website. It could also be a really fun effect to apply to an image. 
                From this tutorial I learned the difference between section and div, the css property white-space and how to create an animation that translates x and y values at the same time. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I have followed tutorials from this Youtube channel before and I have noticed that they use the section tag a lot instead of the div tag. 
                I was curious as to why this way so I did a quick google search and found <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/what-is-the-difference-between-section-and-div-elements.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. 
                I learned that the section tag is used when you want to group items together where as the div tag is simply a container that gains meaning from adding attributes to it. 
            </p> 

            <p> 
                The white-space property was used with the nowrap value as seen below for the sliding class which has children that are span elements with the text inside of them.  
            </p>

            <pre> 
                .sliding {
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 50%;
                    white-space: nowrap;
                    font-size: 12em;
                    line-height: 220px;
                    overflow: hidden;
                    font-family: "arial black";
                    animation: animate 20s linear infinite;
                }
            </pre>

            <p> 
                Here the white-space property was used to keep the text all in one line as the nowrap value makes sure that the text will not wrap to the next line. 
            </p>

            <p>
                To create the sliding text effect the tutorial used an animation with keyframes in CSS. 
                Both the 0% and 100% values are used to signify what will happen at the beginning and end of the animation. 
                The keyframes used are below. 
            </p>

            <pre>
                @keyframes animate {
                    0% {
                        transform: translate(0, -50%);
                    }
                
                    100% {
                        transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
                    }
                }
            </pre>

            <p>
                The first transform is used to center the text along the y-axis inside of the colored backgrounds. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The next transform moves the text across the x-axis to the left because it is a negative value and at the end of the animation the text will have moved 50% to the left which creates the scrolling effect. 
                This also creates the illusion that the text will keep scrolling forever as the animation restarts before the end of the text. 
                Although this effect is created, it is a little choppy when the animation restarts. I think this is something that could be approved upon by messing with the percetage that the text moves on the x-axis. 
            
                The y-axis transformation does not change so the text will always be centered vertically. 
        </p>
            </div>

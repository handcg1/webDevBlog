        <h1> If I Was To Teach CS347</h1>
        <p> If I was to teach CS 347 I would design my version of the course to be very similar to how it was designed this semester. I felt that I was able to learn a lot from the way the course was structured. I really appreciated having synchronous classes twice a week as it helped keep some normalcy with everything being online. I also liked being able to work in groups with my classmates especially this semester where I am not getting to interact with others as often as I normally would. I would definitely still include the video lectures and have the students watch them before class as I found them to be really helpful throughout the semester. It was nice to be able to go back and rewatch lectures when I got stuck on something. I would also still assign the projects. I thought these were a great way to apply what we had learned in class in a practical and useful way. </p>

        <p> I would want to keep some aspect of the labs as I found them to be useful and helpful. However, at times they felt more like a burden and it can be hard to guarantee that everyone is participating. Something that helped me learn the material was completing the labs again by myself especially when my group didn’t get a chance to finish the lab in class. I think having some of the labs be individual homework assignment could be beneficial though I did think it was effective to be able to collaborate with my classmates during class so I wouldn’t want to take that aspect away all together. Another thing I would change is spending more time on React as I felt this content was harder to digest. Overall, I really enjoyed this course and feel confident in using the skills I’ve gained this semester in other classes and the real world. </p>
